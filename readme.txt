Dinamic street lighting with arduino and LDR sensors. 

this project is for an undergrad electronics class project and is far from optimazed. 


the systems uses LDR sensors to detect daytime and movement as well. 

this prototype used three sensors (lined up ) and three output lights (leds)

if you are using this code. pay attention to the constant parameters. 
tune then according to your system and changes them around untill the system is working properly.
